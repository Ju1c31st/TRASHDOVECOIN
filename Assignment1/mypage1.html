  <h3> What is a dank meme? by Paul Gil</h3>
  <!-- https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-meme-2483702-->
  <p>A 'meme' is a virally-transmitted cultural symbol or social idea. The majority of modern memes are captioned photos that are intended to be funny, often as a way to publicly ridicule human behavior. Other memes can be videos and verbal expressions.
    Some memes have heavier and more philosophical content. The world of memes (which rhymes with 'teams') is noteworthy for two reasons: it is a worldwide social phenomenon, and memes behave like a mass of infectious flu and cold viruses, traveling from
    person to person quickly through social media. According to Cecil Adams of theStraightDope.com, the concept of memes "is either really deep or really, really obvious."

  <h3> What is the Trash Dove? </h3>
  <!-- http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trash-doves -->
  <p> Florida artist and Adobe creative resident Syd Weller’s “Trash Doves” sticker set officially made its Facebook debut on January 31st, 2017,
    which included an animated emoji of a headbanging pigeon.
    Trash Doves is a set of Facebook stickers featuring a large-eyed purple pigeon in various situations,
     the most notable of which is an animated sprite of the bird vigorously thrashing its head up and down.
     Shortly after its debut on Facebook at the start of 2017,
    the purple dove sticker set quickly became a viral subject of photoshopped parodies,
     gifs and image macros on the social media.
